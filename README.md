nodewii
=======

This node.js addon helps you program for Nintendo MotionPlus in JavaScript.

Requirements: bluez, cwiid, nodejs, node-gyp

Limitations: ONLY works on linux

I only tested the library on Ubuntu 13.04 with nodejs 0.10.25.
Because of cwiid, I'm sure it doesn't run on Windows or OS X.
I only tested with MotionPlus, but without nunchuck or classic controller, so probably those functions don't work.

Issues!

DO NOT TURN ON EXTENSION REPORTING, because it will break your program.
